-> Paint Weight: Data > Vertex Groups


=> Notes
-> Points on the mesh are vertices (vertex for single)
-> Line connecting 2 vertices is edge
-> Faces are the squares which is made of 4 edges/ vertices making a square
-> Easy to add more resolution later than to remove it
-> (0) Proportional Influence makes it to apply the effects to near by area of modified selected
-> Major Segments: 32 | Minor Segments: 12 | Major Radius: 39 | Minor Radius: 29
-> Renaming: F12 / F2
-> (1) X-Ray allows to do selection across the model regardless the camera position 
-> (2) If normal are inside then move the offset under solidify to 1
-> (3) Can select the snapping behaviour by clicking next to magnate icon
-> Modifiers work from top to bottom, if want to subdivide solidified mesh then 1st should be solidify and then subdivide
-> (2) Smooth edges by > Solidify > Edge Data > Crease Inner to 1
-> If vertices positions are changed or moved, move them back
-> Toggle between Different Modes: ctrl + tab
-> (4) Applies Uniform Values Based On Selected Type
-> (5) Select the child first then the parent > Keep Transform
-> (6) Will hide the base mesh on which the points are shown
-> Sphere: Major Segments: 12 | Minor Segments: 9 | Radius : .01
-> (7) In Scale mode you can type in the value
-> (8) Use scroll wheel to add or remove more detail
-> (9) If duplicate the model containing Geometry Node, press on the 2 shown next to Geometry Nodes.001 to make the changes independent to each other 
-> (10) Blender uses Radiant for rotation and for complete rotation we use TAU which is 2x Pi
-> (11) Can change color type from gradient to constant
-> (12) For non skin meshes set all the values in radius to 1 and scale to .005, as metallic the weight can only be 0 or 1
