=> Weight Paint
-> Paint Weight: Data > Vertex Groups


=> Notes
-> Points on the mesh are vertices (vertex for single)
-> Line connecting 2 vertices is edge
-> Faces are the squares which is made of 4 edges/ vertices making a square
-> Easy to add more resolution later than to remove it
-> (0) Proportional Influence makes it to apply the effects to near by area of modified selected
-> Major Segments: 32 | Minor Segments: 12 | Major Radius: 39 | Minor Radius: 29
-> Renaming: F12 / F2
-> (1) X-Ray allows to do selection across the model regardless the camera position 
-> (2) If normal are inside then move the offset under solidify to 1
-> (3) Can select the snapping behaviour by clicking next to magnate icon
-> Modifiers work from top to bottom, if want to subdivide solidified mesh then 1st should be solidify and then subdivide
-> (2) Smooth edges by > Solidify > Edge Data > Crease Inner to 1
-> If vertices positions are changed or moved, move them back
-> (4) Applies Uniform Values Based On Selected Type
-> (5) Select the child first then the parent > Keep Transform
-> (6) Will hide the base mesh on which the points are shown
-> Sphere: Major Segments: 12 | Minor Segments: 9 | Radius : .01
-> (7) In Scale mode you can type in the value
-> (8) Use scroll wheel to add or remove more detail
-> (9) If duplicate the model containing Geometry Node, press on the 2 shown next to Geometry Nodes.001 to make the changes independent to each other 
-> (10) Blender uses Radiant for rotation and for complete rotation we use TAU which is 2x Pi
-> (11) Can change color type from gradient to constant
-> (12) For non skin meshes set all the values in radius to 1 and scale to .005, as metallic the weight can only be 0 or 1
-> (13) During snapping mode you can navigate using alt + m3
-> (14) During Extrude pressing ctrl and m2 will extrude to cursor, can also do E to extrude, S to scale and shift + Z will lock extrution to X and Y Axis
-> Can change pivot point in the Edit Mode
-> For fixing normals when using shade smooth use shade auto smooth
-> (15) For applying changes from object mode to edit mode, like change scale in object mode will change the scale overall but after applying this action scale will be default to (1,1,1) and edit mode will not be affected
-> (16) Good for adding information in the middle of the face
-> Can convert triangulate model to quad by searching tri to quad
-> Sharp Edge for keeping nearest faces flat when smoothing
-> For scale reference Cube > Edit Mode > G > Z > 1 > Object Mode > S > Z > 2 > S > Shift + Z > .7
